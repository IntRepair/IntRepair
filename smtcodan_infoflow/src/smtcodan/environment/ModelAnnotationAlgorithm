1. Currently: Mgetenv, Mprintf, Mfprintf, Mfwprintf, MLogonUserA and MLogonUserW are annotated
Theyr headr definitions are contained in the virtual folder Standard_C_Library_Headers and in windows_dummy.h


2. Model annotation algorithm:
	//create a comment object from getLibrarySignature
		//see if is single or multiline comment in the map containg such a key
		//@if single get the list from AnnotationParser getSingleLineComment
		  //say something about one paramter or about the function
		  //if it is about one param then this param from index i needs to be set to conf or sensitive
		  //if it is about the function then the interpreter has to be notified with one of the parameters
		  //which parameter is still open the function annotation needs a parameter to be added
		//$else get two lists in two separate lists
		  //list1=AnnotationParser getMultilineFunctionComment
		  //list2=AnnotationParser getMultilineParameterComment
		  //if list 1 contains something then we have to notify the interpreter with that value
		  //the function annotation needs to have also a parameter in order to know which parameter to be send to
		  //the interpreter
		  
		  //if list 2 contains something that we need to set that variable to confidential or sensitive
		
		 
		
		//the best approach is to create a list with all the symbolic variables which are created in the exec()
		//the list should contain the variable and the index ex: method(int a, int b, int c) which one it is in the list
		//by having these thing it is easier to do the annotation with the things provided from @ or $
		
		//the SymFunctionCall all ready contains the list of parameters and the name of the function
